Shutter is a feature-rich screenshot program for Linux based operating systems such as Ubuntu. You can take a screenshot of a specific area, window, your whole screen, or even of a website â€“ apply different effects to it, draw on it to highlight points, and then upload to an image hosting site, all within one window. Shutter is free, [open-source](https://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php), and licensed under [GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).
