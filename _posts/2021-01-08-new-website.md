We have a new website (you're looking at it now!). The old layout was initially
generated via Wordpress, but then lost and restored from
[archive.org](https://archive.org). The result was unmaintainable bunch of
complicated static HTML pages, which resembles dynamic content. Current version
uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

We didn't migrate all the blog content over, and the list of old blog entries
is available [over here](/1980/01/01/old-blog). If you wish to help us migrate
the
[content](https://github.com/shutter-project/shutter-project-website/tree/master/public)
to [native jekyll and
markdown](https://github.com/shutter-project/shutter-jekyll-site/tree/master/_posts),
the help would be welcome!
